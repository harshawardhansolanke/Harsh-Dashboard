This Power BI project on Healthcare Data Analysis involves collecting, processing, and visualizing healthcare-related datasets to provide actionable insights for healthcare professionals and stakeholders. The project integrates various data sources, such as patient records, hospital admissions, treatment outcomes, and medical resource usage. Using Power BI's interactive dashboards, the project enables trend analysis, performance benchmarking, and identification of critical health metrics to support decision-making and improve patient care. Key features include filtering and drill-down capabilities to explore patient demographics, disease patterns, treatment effectiveness, and resource allocation. The project also highlights key healthcare KPIs like patient wait times, readmission rates, and cost analysis, helping optimize operational efficiency and healthcare delivery.
